# About the project

This project is a multiple-choice quiz web application that is built using ReactJS. The app connects to an external API to fetch questions from the database. The app tests the userâ€™s knowledge of technology in general. Each question has four multiple choices and one correct answer. The test has a time frame of five minutes. After that, a popup window will show up, enforcing the user to submit the test.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
